<h2> Biotechnology:- A tool to improve environment:----
    Nowadays, as we can see our environment faces considerable pressure like forecast
       increase in the world population to more than 8.5 billion, limitation of available land 
       and water resources, slow increase in crop yields,demand for cheaper and safer food
       and the need to sustain and improve the surrounding environment. 
       The major sources of environmental pollution are industries, agricultural and other
       anthropogenic and biogenic sources etc.
       The role of biotechnology for improvement in environment is well documented.
       Today, biotechnology is being considered as a emerging technology for improve
       environment or we can say, it can also help in environmental protection. With the
       help of biotechnology we can control environmental pollution through biodegradation
       bio- transformation, bio- accumulation of toxic compounds like organics, metals oil and
       detergents etc. Through biotechnology production of non- conventional,non- polluting
       energy sources like biodiesel methanol, bio- ethanol,  biogas, bio- hydrogen etc.
       Instead of using chemical- pesticides or fertilizers, we can use bio- fertilizers and
       bio- pesticides with the help of biotechnology. Biotechnology also includes tool like
       Biosensor, which is used for monitoring pollution and the recovery of resources from
       toxic or non- toxic wastes through biotechnological approach. Biotechnology is also a 
       pivotal  tool for sustainable develop, which has become a priority for the worldâ€™s policy makers.
       So, Biotechnology has a played an important role towards environmental pollution abatement
        by using environment friendly techniques and products. Overall goal of biotechnology is to attain
        safe and sustainable environment.
